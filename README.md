This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug related to loose comparison (`==`) and type juggling. The `bug.php` file shows the unexpected behavior where a string and an integer are considered equal due to PHP's automatic type conversion. The `bugSolution.php` file illustrates the correct approach using strict comparison (`===`) to avoid this issue.  The loose comparison is dangerous because it may lead to unexpected and hard to debug logic errors. Always consider strict comparison for more predictable and reliable code.
