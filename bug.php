In PHP, a common but often subtle error arises from the interaction between type juggling and the `==` (loose comparison) operator.  Consider this example:

```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
?>
```

While you might expect this to print "Not equal" (since one is a string and the other is an integer), it actually prints "Equal". This is because `==` performs type coercion before comparison. PHP converts the string '10' to an integer 10 before comparing.

This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in conditional logic involving user input or data from external sources, where types might not always be consistent.
